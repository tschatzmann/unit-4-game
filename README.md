# unit-4-game  

This is a guessing game built using JQuery and Javascript.

The initial display of the game page contains the random number the player must match,  along with 4 crystals with random values, instructions and the current score.

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal the program will add a specific amount to the players score.
The player wins the game by matching their total score to the random number. The player loses the game if the
total of their score goes above the random number.
The value of each crystal is hidden from the player until it is clicked on.
Each time the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
